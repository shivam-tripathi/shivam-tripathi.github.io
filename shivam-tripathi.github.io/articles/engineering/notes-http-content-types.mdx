# Notes: HTTP Content Types

HTTP content types, also known as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types, are utilized
to specify the format of the data being transferred through HTTP messages.

Possible types:
1. Application
2. Audio
3. Image
4. Multipart
5. Text
6. Video

## Details


### `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- The default content type used when submitting forms.
- All characters are encoded before being sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special
characters are escaped).
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` has a single byte boundary per field (&), but adds a linear
overhead factor of 3x for every non-printable character. Usual printable characters like a and b
were sent in one byte, while non-printable ones like 0xCF and 0x89 took up 3 bytes each: %CF%89
- It is suitable for simple forms with alphanumeric data.

```js
fetch('http://example.com/form_endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  body: 'name=John+Doe&email=john%40doe.com' // use some library, try not to pull off stunts like this
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```

### `multipart/form-data`
- Typically used for forms that include file uploads or non-ASCII data.
- Does not apply URL encoding. Instead, it separates form data parts using a boundary.
- Used for encoding and transmitting data, especially forms that contain files, non-ASCII data, and binary data.
- Use multipart/form-data if the form contains a file upload, and application/x-www-form-urlencoded
otherwise, which is the default if you omit `enctype`.
- `multipart/form-data` adds a few bytes of boundary overhead to the message, and must spend some
time calculating.
- Use Cases:
	- File uploads: Submitting forms that contain files, text, or a mix of files and text.
	- API requests: When sending mixed textual and binary data in a single payload to a REST API.

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('name', 'John Doe');
formData.append('email', 'john@doe.com');
formData.append('file', new Blob(['Hello, world!'], { type: 'text/plain' }), 'hello.txt');

fetch('http://example.com/form_endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### `application/json`
- Data is encoded in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
- Used literally everywhere.

### `application/xml`
- Data is encoded in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format.
- Sometimes used in old school APIs, RPCs.

### `application/octet-stream`
- Used in binary data, or data that isn't in a structured textual format.
- `text/plain` is the default value for textual files. A textual file should be human-readable
and must not contain binary data. `application/octet-stream` is the default value for all other
cases. An unknown file type should use this type. Browsers are particularly careful when
manipulating these files to protect users from software vulnerabilities and possible
dangerous behavior.
- Generally used to transmit raw binary data or data that doesn't conform to other Content-Type
specifications.
- Use cases:
	- Downloading files: For instance, when a browser downloads a file, it might be sent as
	application/octet-stream.
	- Uploading binary data to the server without any specific encoding or multipart splitting.
- Does not allow you to upload multiple files in a single request-body or mix binary files with
regular form fields. Does not include metadata about the data in the payload.
- Vs multipart/form-data:
	- Use application/octet-stream when dealing with pure binary data without the need for additional
	fields or metadata.
	- Use multipart/form-data when dealing with forms and API requests that involve files, non-ASCII
	data, binary data, or a mixture of text and binary data, especially when metadata about each part
	needs to be provided.

```js
fetch('http://example.com/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
  },
  body: new Blob([/* your data */], { type: 'application/octet-stream' })
});
```

### `application/zip`
- Usage: Zip compressed file data.
- `.zip`: Zip format can use various compression algorithms, like Deflate, though it is also known
for packaging files without compression. Can contain multiple compressed files and directories and
might employ various compression methods.
- Typical Use Cases: File compression and archiving.
- Can store additional file attributes, such as file comments and encryption.

### `application/gzip`
- Usage: Gzip compressed file data.
- `.gz`: Gzip uses the Deflate compression algorithm.
- Considerations:
	- Single File: Gzip is typically used to compress a single file.
	- To compress multiple files/directories, they must be concatenated into a single stream (e.g.,
	a tar archive) before being gzipped, often resulting in a `.tar.gz` file.
	- Compression Efficiency: Often provides slightly better compression ratios than Zip, especially
	for larger files.
- Typical Use Cases: File compression and transfers.

### `application/pdf`
- Usage: Data is formatted as a PDF.
- Typical Use Cases: Document viewing and sharing.

### `application/javascript`
- Usage: JavaScript code.
- Typical Use Cases: Client-side scripting for web pages.

### Images ones
- image/gif
- image/tiff
- image/vnd.djvu
- image/jpeg
- image/svg+xml
- image/png
- image/x-icon
- image/vnd.microsoft.icon

### Text ones
- text/css
- text/javascript (obsolete): use application/javascript
- text/plain
- text/html
- text/xml
- text/csv



### Non-printable characters
- "Non-printable" characters refer to characters that do not represent a written symbol that is
printable or visible. They are often control characters, derived from the first 32 characters of the
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) table, which were originally designed to
control hardware devices.
- Examples:
	- NULL (0)
	- SOH, STX, ETX, etc. (ASCII 1-3): Start of Header, Start of Text, and End of Text
	- EOT (ASCII 4): End of Transmission.

- When a binary file (e.g., image, audio, video, or a document) is uploaded through a form, it
inherently contains non-printable characters. Binary files are often composed of a combination of
printable and non-printable characters, which all need to be correctly transmitted to preserve the
fileâ€™s integrity.
- Binary data or strings containing non-printable characters often need to be encoded (e.g., Base64
encoded) to ensure safe transmission over HTTP.
- When sending files or binary data, ensuring that you're using an appropriate Content-Type (like
application/octet-stream or multipart/form-data) is crucial for the receiving system to interpret
the data correctly.
- Ensuring data integrity through checksums or other verification mechanisms is important, as binary
data can be susceptible to corruption during transmission.

### `enctype`
According to HTML5 references, there are three possibilities for enctype:
1. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
2. `multipart/form-data`: (spec points to RFC7578)
3. `text/plain`: Almost never used.


### Misc
- netstat echo server: while true; do printf '' | nc -l localhost 8000; done
- Works on ubuntu.
