# URL Shortener

A URL shortener is a service that allows you to take a long URL and create a shorter, easier-to-remember
link that redirects to the original URL. The short URL is typically composed of a shorter domain
name and a series of characters that represent the original URL. For example, the URL
`https://www.quizizz.com/refer/referrer_id/campaign_id` could be shortened to `https://quiz.iz/5z3b9`.

URL shorteners have become increasingly popular for several reasons:
- Easy to share: Long URLs can be difficult to share, especially on social media platforms like
Twitter that limit the number of characters you can use in a post. Shortened URLs are much easier to
share and can help make your posts more concise.
- Track clicks: Often we require additional analytics that allow you to track how many clicks your
shortened links are receiving. This information can be useful for measuring the success of your
marketing campaigns or tracking engagement.
- Save space: Shortened URLs take up less space than long URLs, which can be especially important
in text messages or other situations where space is limited. For example, in cases like reset
password, we might have to send links in SMS which are usually charged by character count.
- Hide the original URL: Shortened URLs can be used to hide the original URL, which can be useful
in situations where the original URL is long, unappealing, or contains sensitive information.
- Redirect traffic: URL shorteners can be used to redirect traffic to different landing pages or
websites, which can be useful for A/B testing, redirecting traffic to affiliate links, or directing
users to specific content

## Base62
One way to implement a URL shortener is by using base 62 encoding.
In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement a URL shortener using base 62 encoding.

### What is Base 62 Encoding?
Base 62 encoding is a method of encoding numbers using the digits 0-9, lowercase letters a-z, and
uppercase letters A-Z. In base 62 encoding, each character in the encoding represents a unique
number between 0 and 61. This allows us to represent large numbers with a shorter string of
characters.

This is similar to binary (0 and 1), decimal (0-9) or hexadecimal (0-9 and A-F to
represent numbers till 16) encodings - but in this case we use 62 characters (which are easily human
readable characters - numbers 0-9, lowercase and uppercase english characters) which gives let's us
represent larger numbers compacted into shorter strings.

### How Does URL Shortening Work?
URL shortening works by taking a long URL and generating a short URL that redirects to the original
URL. To implement URL shortening using base 62 encoding, we first need to generate a unique ID for
each URL that we want to shorten. We can do this by using a counter that increments every time a new
URL is added to the database. Once we have a unique ID, we can convert it to a base 62 encoded
string.

### How to Implement URL Shortening Using Base 62 Encoding?
#### Step 1: Create a Database
The first step in implementing a URL shortener using base 62 encoding is to create a database to
store the URLs.
The database should have two columns: one for the long URL and one for the integer id. Whenever
someone looks up a short url, we decode the url to primary serial id and get original URL.

`Note:` As the lookup can be on long URL as well, it's a good idea to index the field as well. In case of
Postgres, we do not explicitly need to create an unique index - as adding a unique constraint will
automatically create a unique B-tree index on the column or group of columns listed in the
constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE url_shortener (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  url TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  clicks INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  redirect_type INT DEFAULT 302,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Step 2: Generate Unique IDs

The next step is to generate a unique ID for each URL that we want to shorten. In our case, adding
entry in the field ensures we do not insert same URL twice and every entry is mapped against a
unique integer value. To avoid error on insertion we can something like:

```sql
INSERT INTO url_shortener (url) SELECT 'qcom2' ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

#### Step 3: Encode the id for the URL

Once we have a unique ID for each URL, we can convert it to a base 62 encoded string. We can do
this by:
1. Define a string containing the digits and letters that represent the 62 possible values in base 62.
For example, you could use the string

`0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`.

2. Divide the input integer by 62 and keep track of the remainder. Convert the remainder to a
character using the digit/letter string from step 1.
3. Repeat step 2 with the quotient until the quotient is zero.
4. Concatenate the characters from step 2 in reverse order to form the base 62 representation of the
input integer.

```rs
// Every eligible character represents a number in range [0, 62)
const BASE62_ALPHABET: &[u8; 62] = b"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

fn encode_base62(mut num: u64) -> String {
  let mut base62 = vec![];
  // input zero errors are pretty ugly in problems where we rely on mod
  if num == 0 {
    base62.push(BASE62_ALPHABET[0]);
  } else {
    while num > 0 {
        let rem = (num % 62) as usize;
        // remainder is mapped to base62 mapping above - modulus returns an index [0, 62).
        base62.push(BASE62_ALPHABET[rem]);
        num /= 62;
    }
    base62.reverse();
  }
  String::from_utf8(base62).unwrap()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  #[test]
  fn test_encode() {
      assert_eq!(encode_base62(0), String::from("0"));
      assert_eq!(encode_base62(123456789), String::from("8m0Kx"));
      assert_eq!(encode_base62(999999999), String::from("15FTGf"));
      assert_eq!(encode_base62(123456789012), String::from("2aL26ws"));
      assert_eq!(encode_base62(9223372036854775807), String::from("LygHa16AHYF"));
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Decode the short URL

Once someone hits the shorter URL, we can decode the shorter URL to get the primary key which then
can be used to extract the long URL. We can do this by:
1. Define a string containing the digits and letters that represent the 62 possible values in base 62.
For example, you could

`0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`.

2. Iterate over the characters in the base 62 encoding in reverse order. For each character, find
its index in the digit/letter string from step 1.
3. Multiply the value of the index by 62 raised to the power of its position in the encoding
(starting from 0).
4. Add up the results of step 3 for each character in the encoding to obtain the decimal value of
the base 62 encoding.

```rs
const BASE62_ALPHABET: &[u8; 62] = b"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

fn decode_base62(encoded: &str) -> u64 {
  let mut num = 0;
  for c in encoded.bytes() {
    let val = match c {
      // if character lies in [0, 9] range, it is mapped between [0-10)
      b'0'..=b'9' => c - b'0',
      // if character lies in [a, z] range it is mapped between [10-36)
      b'a'..=b'z' => c - b'a' + 10,
      // if character lies in [A, Z] range it is mapped between [36-62)
      b'A'..=b'Z' => c - b'A' + 36,
      // invalid character
      _ => panic!("Invalid base62 character: {}", c),
    } as u64;
    num = num * 62 + val;
  }
  num
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  #[test]
  fn test_decode() {
    assert_eq!(decode_base62(String::from("0")), 0);
    assert_eq!(decode_base62(String::from("8m0Kx")), 123456789);
    assert_eq!(decode_base62(String::from("15FTGf")), 999999999);
    assert_eq!(decode_base62(String::from("2aL26ws")), 123456789012);
    assert_eq!(decode_base62(String::from("LygHa16AHYF")), 9223372036854775807);
  }
}
```

#### Serve the URL
Based on whether we want to do a permanent redirect or a temporary one, we can set the status code
as 301 or 302.

A permanent redirect is indicated by an HTTP status code of 301 Moved Permanently. This status code
is used to indicate that the original URL has been permanently replaced by a new URL. When a web
browser or search engine crawler encounters a permanent redirect, it will update its index or cache
to point to the new URL. Permanent redirects are useful when a website has changed its URL structure
or has moved to a new domain.

In our case, in case of permanent redirects we will miss out on
getting analytics metadata like clicks as client browsers will never hit the old short url again.
This, however, can be controlled with a TTL.

On the other hand, a temporary redirect is indicated by an HTTP status code of 302 Found or 307
Temporary Redirect. This status code is used to indicate that the original URL has been temporarily
replaced by a new URL. When a web browser or search engine crawler encounters a temporary redirect,
it will temporarily update its index or cache to point to the new URL, but it will continue to check
the original URL for updates. Temporary redirects are useful when a website is temporarily
unavailable or has moved to a different URL for a short period of time.

In our case, it is helpful if we want to track each time the main the short URL is hit.

```rs
use actix_web::{HttpResponse, ResponseError, web, get};
use sqlx::{PgPool, Postgres, Row};

#[get("/{short_url}")]
async fn redirect(short_url: web::Path<String>, db_pool: web::Data<PgPool>) -> Result<HttpResponse, sqlx::Error> {
  // Decode the short_url into u62 primary key
  let id = decode_base62(short_url);
  // Query the database for the long URL and redirect type
  let result = sqlx::query("SELECT url, redirect_type FROM url_shortener WHERE id = $1")
    .bind(&id)
    .fetch_one(db_pool.get_ref())
    .await?;
  let long_url: String = result.get(0);
  let redirect_type: i32 = result.get(1);

  // Determine the redirect status code based on the redirect type value
  let status_code = if redirect_type == 301 { 301 } else { 302 };

  // Perform the redirect
  Ok(HttpResponse::build(status_code)
    .header("Location", long_url)
    .finish())
}
```
