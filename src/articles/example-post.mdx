This is an example of how to write blog posts as MDX files directly in your project!

## Benefits of Using MDX

- **Easier to maintain**: All your blog posts are in one place
- **No build step needed**: Just write and refresh
- **Better formatting**: Use proper markdown editors
- **Version control**: Track posts in git naturally

## How to Use

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/articles/`
2. Write your content in markdown
3. Import it in `src/data/blogs.js` using the `importMDXArticle()` utility

## Note Example

Here is a sentence with a :note[highlighted section]{content="This is a note that appears in the sidebar! You can put **markdown** in here too."}. Click it to see the note.

## Code Example

Here's some code:

```javascript
// Beautiful syntax highlighting
export function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Lists

### Unordered
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item
- Item 3

### Ordered
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote and it looks great!
> Perfect for highlighting important ideas.

## Next Steps

Copy this file, rename it, and start writing your own posts! Each post will be automatically picked up by the blog system.

Happy writing! 📝
