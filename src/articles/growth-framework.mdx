This framework helps product managers and growth teams systematically approach user acquisition, retention, and activation through structured channels.

## Key Components

- **R**eached: Who can you reach?
- **A**cquired: How do you acquire them?
- **C**onverted: How do you convert them to active users?
- **E**ngaged: How do you keep them engaged?
- **C**apture value: How do you capture value (monetize)?
- **A**dvocate: How do you turn them into advocates?
- **R**etention: How do you retain them long-term?

This systematic approach ensures no aspect of the user journey is overlooked.
