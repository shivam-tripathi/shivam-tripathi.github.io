title: Beginning Photography - Basics 
---

As I plan to learn photography this semester, I thought why not keep a record of what all I learn?

Digital single-lens reflex camera (also called Digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera combining optics and mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. 

I was a bit confused about some terms related to photography, so I googled them up and here are what they mean :

**Exposure**
"Exposure" is the process of exposing the image sensor to light. Using this, we can adjust *light* in a photograph - we can make a bright sunlit scene appear dark, or a dark room appear brighter. DSLRs have an option of automatic adjustment of exposure -  these adjust exposure of any photograph so that it is of optimal brightness. This is usually to as "optimal exposure".
Reducing exposure sometimes brings the color of the sky, increasing exposure brings details in the darker regions.

**Adjusting exposure in a DSLR**
Shutter speed and aperture of the camera are essentially used to adjust the exposure of any photograph. ISO sensitivity is another factor.
As is obvious, faster shutter speed means lesser amount of time the image sensor is exposed to light. Smaller shutter speed means less exposure and more shutter speed means more exposure. 

Aperture (expressed as an f-number) controls amount of light which enters the camera and falls on the image sensor. The f-number is the reciprocal of aperture size - higher the f-number means lesser exposure and smaller f-number means more exposure. 

A good combination of aperture and shutter speed produces a good image. Same exposure can be obtained by proper combination of increased f-number and decreased shutter speed or decreased f-number and increased shutter speed.

Representation in camera of shutter speeds more than one second is done by showing them in fraction like "1/200", "1/250" etc. Sometimes numerators are omitted and in this case speeds slower than 1 second are shown by double prime before the number - " ''250 ".

The f-number representation is shown in steps of 1/3 EV, for example f/4, f/4.5, f/5, f/7.1, f/8 etc.
