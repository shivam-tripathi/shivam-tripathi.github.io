100 words challenge. This post collects all the new (and old) words I happen to learn (or recall) each day. The words may have multiple meanings, out of which I am usually covering only one (at a time); usually in the context the word came up. I would have loved to add phonetic representation (or audio clips), but at the moment it isn't possible. Cheers.

## Day eight


****


_Always aim to condense the series of words which come to your mind (while describe something) in as few words as possible. For example, replacing "those who remain to themselves" by "reserved". You will be surprised as to how you are able to frame sentences considerably better - not just write smaller versions of the initial sentences; after all brevity is the essence of wit!_
