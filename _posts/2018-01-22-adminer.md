title: Adminer for Mac - Accessing databases made easy!

![Adminer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adminer/one.jpg "Adminer")


#### First set up Apache and PHP on Mac using [this]("https://shivam-tripathi.github.io/mac-php-apache/").

#### For other OS, see relevant guides.

## Introduction
Handling databases using command line has always been a hassle. Using GUI tools helps not only understand the data better, but also increase productivity by helping to spend more time writing code and less time figuring out the output. Adminer stands out in this regards, it's a one stop solution for most of the major databases in the market presently (namely MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB).

## Installation
It's simply a php file. Yes, one single php file that's all. You can head over to the [official site](https://www.adminer.org/) to download this file.

Once downloaded, place it in the location where apache webserver looks for files. Also make sure that apache has php turned on. Alternatively, you can also set a separate virtual host to run the php file.

In my case, apache looks for files in the  `~/Sites` folder, so I placed the file in `~/Sites/adminer` folder and renamed it to `index.php`. Having done that, I simply run `shivamtripathi.local/adminer` in the browser, where `shivamtripathi.local` is my virtual host (see [this]("https://shivam-tripathi.github.io/mac-php-apache/")), and voila :

![Adminer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adminer/two.jpeg "Adminer")

*NOTE* : The Server field has a placeholder `localhost` which _has to be filled in_. Fill it with `localhost`.

We can also add custom css to make it look even more sleek. The theme I used :
```zsh
cd ~/Sites/adminer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pappu687/adminer-theme/master/adminer.css
```
Fire up the browser again, this time to a revamped looking adminer :
![Adminer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adminer/three.jpeg "Adminer")

![Adminer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/adminer/four.jpeg "Adminer")

Cheers!
