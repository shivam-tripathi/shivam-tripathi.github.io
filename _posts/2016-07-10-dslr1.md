DSLR is an abbreviation for the Digital Single Lens Reflex camera. As the name points out, it uses digital image sensors with Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera mechanism, which is a form of cameras very common in the past.
If we look at a DSLR construction, the following parts happen to be very common across vendors:

1. Lens
2. Viewfinder eyepiece window
3. Shutter-release button

SLR cameras are distinguishable from other forms of cameras by the fact that they have an optical viewfinder which displays the view through the lens. The single lens serves for both the purposes – for taking photographs and for the viewfinder. The viewfinder displays the scene before the camera using mechanisms of mirrors to reflect the light from the lens to itself (hence the word reflex). The viewfinder thus allows the photographer to view the image from the camera lens directly, before taking any photographs.

An interesting thing happens when the shutter-release button is pressed. When the button is pressed, the set of mirrors directing the image from the lens to the viewfinder are raised, and the light from the camera lens moves directly to the light sensors (behind the shutter curtains, which open up to let light in to the sensors). Therefore, the shutter-release button controls whether the light is drawn to the viewfinder, or to the image sensors. You can call the shutter-release button to be “click” button in regular language.

That's all there is to a simple DSLR camera. :smile:
