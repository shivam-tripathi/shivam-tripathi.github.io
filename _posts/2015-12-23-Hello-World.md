First Post :)

Setting up a markdown based blog is a quick method to share ideas. Also, it's customized according to one's needs. You can clone this setup using [this](https://github.com/shivam-tripathi/shivam-tripathi.github.io.git) or [download as a zip](https://github.com/shivam-tripathi/shivam-tripathi.github.io/archive/master.zip). I have kept readability at maximum priority in my setup, avoiding all fancy stuff. I have taken Charter and Kievit fonts, and color theme is very simple too. Color theme can very well be modified, a few I have in mind are:

* White and #14141C
* White and #00C37F
* White and #E25044

I personally prefer light themes for better readability, but you can modify according to your tastes. What's even more cool, you have emojis! :smile:

Happy blogging!
