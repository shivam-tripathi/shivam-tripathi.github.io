“Mother! mother!” sounded a voice as the parlour was flung open. A young boy in his early teens rushed in, out of breadth. “What is it Jim?” apathetic voice from the counter asked.  
“There are men on horses. Mr. Kennedy is out to receive them” the boy replied. The lady at the counter pulled her spectacles down, and looked over them at the panting boy. “Who on earth could land up here at this time of the year”, she wondered.  
King’s Lynn was a small market town in the ceremonial county of Norfolk, in East Anglia. It was here where Mrs. Margaret Reed ran her small tavern. Mrs. Reed had been widowed for some time now, and little Jimmy was her only child. It was often hard for her to make ends meet, with whatever her drunkard husband had left her and the small inn she ran — but she was happy in her small world.  
“Mr. Kennedy himself? Why, they must be some very important people then” a voice from across the parlour echoed. “The mayor doesn’t get out to receive everyone” the man said, struggling to keep his balance. He smelt harshly of liquor. “Jimmy, get back to your books. Don’t let me see you frivolling your time away. And as for you, brother, you don’t have anything better to do than drink your time away. How do you imagine bills … “  
They were interrupted by a middle aged man who had just entered through the door. It was Mr. Farfrae, one of most respected and well known man of knowledge in King’s Lynn. “Come on now woman, no need to get cross with the man. Say Jimmy, where are these men staying?” the old man enquired.  
“In the King’s Coat of Arms, Mr. Farfrae.” the boy replied. “Well, then it’s as I suspected.” Mr. Farfrae said dismally. “Suspected what, sir?” still a little cross Mrs. Reed asked. “I heard the rumors some time back. Now with the mayor and the expensive boarding; Matthew Hopkins and his men are here in Kings Lynn.” At this Donald became hysterical. Perhaps he had drunk too much. “Purists are here Marge!” he shouted. “Welcome death! Welcome death!” he tried to scare Jimmy.  
A bit of scare shot through Mrs. Reed — a sense of foreboding. “Who is this Matthew Hopkins?” Jimmy asked with curious eyes. “Hush, Jim. Get back inside.” yelled Margaret, as Donald continued to laugh hysterically.  
…  
Mrs. Reed was a little vexed. She was worried about Jimmy, her small store, her small perfect world in King’s Lynn. Who knew what impending dangers these ominous men brought with themselves.  
In truth, her fears were not entirely baseless, as appearance of these men in King’s Lynn really did mean death. The man in question here was Matthew Hopkins, highly celebrated “Witch finder”, who persuaded the credulous and superstitious that he possessed the art of discovering such as gifted with witchcraft. Those placed under him to go through this cruel test, were generally condemned, as he was paid a certain sum per head for every poor soul he condemned guilty. Margaret had heard stories how he had murdered many across the whole of East Anglia. But no one ever opposed, lest they should face the wrath of witch finders themselves.  
And this time, it was King’s Lynn.  
…  
It was almost evening. Jimmy, trying hard to keep at his books, continued to doze off every now and then. A sudden commotion in the parlour woke him up, and he drowsily walked towards the source of sound. He was met with a very tense looking Donald, accompanied by an equally terrified Mayor and some sinister looking men. “Where is mother?” stuttered Jimmy.
“Ah! Jimmy, how are you little man?“ Donald said, trying to sound as cheerful as he can, and waved his hand over Jimmy’s head. Jimmy could perceive a sense of heaviness in the air. From the group of men, a man came forward, smiling all the way. He had thick beard, and was of average height. “So this is the child?” he asked blandly.  
“Y..yes ..” said the mayor sheepishly.  
“Poor child. Losing his mother at such a young age.” the man smirked, and turned back to the mayor. “We have found what we came for. It is the will of the God to purge her soul clean.”  
Jimmy, baffled, looked at Donald. “Clean …?” he mumbled.  
It took Jimmy a moment to understand the situation. Red with anger, he flung himself at the man. “Where is mother? What did you do to her?” shrieked Jimmy, but was pulled back by Donald. The man merely sniggered at this.  
He looked around the place, and said “I can see that this place is enraptured in evil too.” He turned very calmly turned around, and just before he was about to leave; said “Burn it down too”. The men accompanying him set ablaze everything around. Donald caught Jimmy in his arms and ran out of the house, closely followed by Mr. Kennedy.  
…  
“I want to see her!” struggled Jimmy, as Donald restrained the young boy trying to calm him down. “You can’t Jimmy” said Donald. “No! I want to see her!” Jimmy shrieked — trying to break free from Donald’s hold. “I said, you can’t!”. “I want to see my mother” — with a sudden jerk, Jimmy released himself from Donald’s hold, and bolted away. Donald distraughtly ran after him.  
…  
There was a huge gathering today at the Tuesday marketplace. Hundreds of residents had gathered, carrying forks and flambeaus. Jimmy dashed towards the gathering, trying to avoid being knocked down by the crowd.  
“Where is she? Where is the witch?” shouted someone from the crowd. Jimmy could almost see the center of the marketplace, where a huge stake had been driven into the ground. Next to it was the mayor, along with the Bishop of King’s Lynn who wrinkled beyond his years with a posture that sagged. And there was that spiteful man.  
Jimmy’s eyes were desperately searching for his mother, until he finally saw her. All she wore was a ragged gown. Her eyes were red from sobbing, and her hair shaggy. Three men dragged her towards the stake. She was in shackles. She continued to weep and shout, but Jimmy could make nothing of it due to continuous loud murmuring by the crowd.  
Before Jimmy could think of anything, an arm pulled him back. “Let go of me!” Jimmy shrieked, although no one appeared to be able to hear him. Donald dragged him out of the crowd, and constrained him.  
“I am going to get my mother back! Let go of me!”  
“You can’t Jimmy, you can’t … “  
“How can you let them do this? Let go!”  
“Because … because … “, Donald said teary eyed — “if we resist — if anyone resists — they’ll burn us too.” Jimmy’s blood ran cold. “There is nothing you can do, but cheer the stake. Cause if you don’t, they’ll burn you too. Do you understand? They’ll burn everything.”  
There was nothing left to be pawned. The noise was deafening. Jimmy felt completely numb — and fell unconscious. Donald looked dismally at the unconscious boy, and picked him up in his arms. He wanted to leave, his heart never had the courage to watch what was going to happen next. But he was aware of the members of the witch hunting troupe, who just needed one wrong move on his part to drag him and Jimmy to the stake too. Donald knew exactly what he had to do. Gathering all the courage he could, he turned around towards the stake and shouted on top of his voice “Burn the witch!”. His cry was met with even louder uproar from the crowd. “Burn the witch! Burn the witch! … “ they all chanted in unison.  
The golden glow from the torches fell on the Margaret and the men around her.  
The Bishop, carrying an enormous cross, started to murmur verses from the Bible. The group of men continued to drag Margaret towards the stake by her hair. “No! No! Please! Please leave me! “ she sobbed hysterically. “Mr .. Mr. Kennedy, please stop these men …” she pleaded — “No! Don’t touch me!”. Mr. Kennedy shivered delinquently, and looked the other way.There was nothing he could do.  
Then the Bishop came forward. He motioned the crowd to stop. Very soon, there was absolute silence. “Children of the God! Today is a holy day. For it is today that King’s Lynn is to be cleansed of evil.” the bishop cried out. The crowd cheered in appreciation, while Donald stood with Jimmy in his arms. The Bishop then turned towards the stake, and pointed at Margaret with a look of revulsion. “This woman, Margaret Reed” the bishop said as his face shivered with intensity, “has been accused and found guilty of not just murdering her husband to please the Satan, but also abduct young children for taking them to Satan’s sabbath! Thanks to these noble men, this has been proved and we have identified such a vicious creature living amongst us.” The crowd cheered fiercely. The Bishop now held the cross high up in the air. His wrinkled face was filled with abhorrence as golden glow from torches fell on him. He began to chant “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the holy Spirit, I, Bishop of King’s Lynn, declare Margaret Reed a witch, and condemn her to die by burning.” It was followed by a huge uproar.  
Donald watched feebly as one of the men gave the torch to Hopkins. Hopkins first raised the torch towards the crowd, as if to greet their applaud, and then threw it at the stake. As the flames began to consume her flesh, and she shrieked with pain. But they were rendered inaudible, as the crowd began to get louder and louder. Perhaps it was all too banal for them — it was solely a Roman holiday for them.  
Donald had become completely paralyzed, he couldn’t hear a word. But it was at this moment when he saw something. No, it couldn’t be, he thought. His mind is playing tricks on him, he thought. He rubbed his eyes and looked harder. Margaret was looking at him. It was too difficult to see through the flames, but Donald had no doubt. He slowly raised Jimmy towards her, and closed his eyes. The crowd, which was seconds ago was in flashes of jeer and anger, had now become bereft.  
_The chilly winter air echoed with a faint laughter._  
Donald, petrified, opened his eyes. The laughter continued, getting louder every second. The mayor fainted, some of the men near the stake began to draw back from the pyre.  
And then something unanticipated happened. It was as if her chest had exploded — there was a big splatter of blood, which directly fell on the Bishop’s face.  
Her heart had ruptured out of her body, and bounced off the church building directly opposite to her pyre, leaving a bloodstain. Horrified, the crowd became a chaos. The entire crowd dispersed within minutes — as the flames continued to grow.  
The next day, they looked for her heart all over the place, but they couldn’t find it. The ‘Witchfinder General’ Matthew Hopkins continued to claim five more victims and was rewarded with 15 pounds by the mayor for cleansing Kings’ Lynn of the evil.  
THE END.  
_In 1590, a woman by the name of Margaret Reed was burned at the stake for being declared a witch. As the flames started devouring her, her heart exploded from her chest and smashed against the wall of the house belonging to the priest who outed her. It is then said that the still beating heart rolled all the way to Ouse (the nearby river) and disappeared into the waters.
Even today, if one looks closely at the building, above the middle window on the second floor, one can still see where her heart hit the wall.
Although a victim of 16th century England’s obsession with witchcraft, Margaret Read was not a victim of East Anglia’s most infamous witch-hunter — the self-styled ‘Witchfinder General’ Matthew Hopkins.
Hopkins began his witch-finding purges in March 1645 and retired in 1647. He was active in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire. Although only active for just fourteen months Hopkins and his associates condemned to death (and murdered) more people for witchcraft than had been tried and killed in the preceding 160 years by all the other witchfinders put together! In fact, some estimates suggest that Hopkins and his cronies were responsible for at least 40% of the total of all the deaths of condemned ‘witches’ that occurred in England between the early 15th and late 18th centuries — a 300-year period! Witch-killing was a lucrative past-time for Hopkins. Records show that King’s Lynn paid Hopkins the sum of £15 for ‘clearing the town of witches’ — this was at a time when the average daily wage was 2.5p!_
