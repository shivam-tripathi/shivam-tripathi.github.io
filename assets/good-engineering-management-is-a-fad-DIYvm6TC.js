const e='# Notes on “Good engineering management” is a fad (via) Will Larson\n\nEngineering managers are currently navigating a quiet identity crisis. Expectations for the role have shifted rapidly, and many leaders sense that something fundamental is changing - not just in *how* work gets done, but in *who* they are expected to be.\n\nA powerful lens for understanding this shift comes from Will Larson’s recent blog, *[Good Engineering Management is a Fad](https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad/)*.\n\nLarson doesn’t speak in terms of archetypes or identity. Instead, he offers a structural, business-driven explanation of why management styles rotate and which skills endure. But once we grasp his economic argument, we can connect it to the personal reality managers are living through: the uncertainty, the tension, and the difficulty of reconciling past advice with present demands.\n\n\n## **How We Got Here: The Economics of Management Eras**\n\nLarson breaks down the evolution of engineering leadership into three eras. Crucially, these shifts weren\'t driven by moral philosophy ("this is the way"), but by hard economic constraints.\n\n### **1. Pre-Hypergrowth (2000s): The Era of Deployment Risk**\n* **The Constraint:** Shipping software was high-risk. Without modern CI/CD or cloud infrastructure, deployments were infrequent and dangerous.\n* **The Style:** Managers were technical gatekeepers. They had to be deeply involved in the code and architecture because a mistake could take down the business for days.\n* **The Vibe:** High-stakes execution. The manager was a **Captain** - decisive, directive, and hands-on to prevent the ship from sinking.\n\n### **2. Hypergrowth (2010s–2021): The Era of Hiring Constraints**\n* **The Constraint:** Capital was cheap (ZIRP), but talent was scarce. The bottleneck was hiring and retaining engineers.\n* **The Style:** Managers were rewarded for coaching, recruiting, and creating psychological safety. "Servant/Coaching Leadership" became the dominant religion.\n* **The Vibe:** Culture cultivation. The manager was a **Gardener** - nurturing growth, removing weeds (blockers), and focusing on the environment rather than the individual output.\n\n### **3. The Post-ZIRP Era (2024–Present): The Era of Efficiency**\n* **The Constraint:** Capital is expensive. Organizations are flattening. AI has changed the leverage of individual contributors.\n* **The Style:** Efficiency, execution, and technical judgment are paramount again. Managers are expected to be closer to the details and drive tangible outcomes.\n* **The Vibe:** A hybrid demand for high-leverage delivery.\n\nThe risk today is that managers internalize the "Gardener" story as a moral absolute, rather than recognizing it was an optimization for a specific economic moment that has now passed.\n\n\n## **The Enduring Skills (What Will Advises)**\n\nInstead of anchoring to the style of a specific decade, Larson suggests building a portfolio of skills that survive market rotations.\n\n**The Core (Baseline Requirements):**\n* **Execution:** Ensuring the team delivers reliably.\n* **Team Building:** Creating an environment where performance is possible.\n* **Ownership:** Navigating reality to move the business forward.\n* **Alignment:** Keeping the team connected to company goals.\n\n**The Growth Layer (Seniority & Range):**\n* **Taste:** possessing the judgment to know what "good" looks like.\n* **Clarity:** Making complex decisions and plans understandable.\n* **Ambiguity:** Turning messy, undefined problems into viable paths.\n* **Timescales:** Balancing the fire of today with the architecture of next year.\n\nA manager who develops breadth across these skills remains relevant regardless of interest rates.\n\n\n## **The Identity Layer: Why This Feels So Hard**\n\nWhile Larson’s framework is logically sound, the transition hits managers at an emotional level. For a decade, the industry told managers that "good" leadership meant stepping back, empowering others, and avoiding the code. Managers built their professional identities around being empathetic coaches (Gardeners). Now, the market is asking for decisive intervention and technical grit (Captains).\n\nThis leads to a confusing internal monologue:\n* *"Do I need to be hands-on again? Is that micromanagement?"*\n* *"Is coaching no longer valued?"*\n* *"Did the last ten years of leadership advice expire overnight?"*\n\nThese aren’t just tactical questions: they are questions of self-worth. Managers feel torn because they trained specifically to be Gardeners, and they are now being deployed into a storm that requires a Captain.\n\n\n## **A New Mental Model: The Captain-Gardener Hybrid**\n\nLarson doesn\'t use these metaphors, but my interpretation is that they act as a "translation layer" for his structural arguments.\n\n| Era | Metaphor | Primary Instinct |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **2000s** | **The Captain** | Directive, protective, technically deep. |\n| **2010s** | **The Gardener** | Nurturing, empowering, culture-focused. |\n| **Now** | **The Hybrid** | Situational awareness. |\n\nThe current era doesn\'t retire the Gardener; it asks you to wake up the Captain.\n\nManagers today must cultivate teams and support individuals (Gardener), but they must also step into technical detail and drive swift execution when leverage requires it (Captain). It is no longer enough to purely "empower" - sometimes you must "direct."\n\n\n## **Synthesis**\n\nWill Larson’s message is that **roles change with eras, but core skills persist.**\n\nHowever, there is a necessary emotional context to all of this as well: **It is okay to feel the friction of this transition.** You are not a bad manager for feeling like the rules changed mid-game - because they did.\n\nTo succeed now, we must stop viewing "hands-on" and "hands-off" as moral binaries. Instead, we must view them as tools in a toolkit, ready to be deployed depending on the season we are in.\n';export{e as default};
